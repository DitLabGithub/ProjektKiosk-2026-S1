# Project Kiosk
## A Game About Identity, Privacy, and Choice

---

## 🎯 The Pitch in One Line

**"Papers, Please meets Modern Privacy"** - A narrative game teaching Self-Sovereign Identity through the eyes of a kiosk clerk.

---

## 💭 The Problem

Right now, your digital identity is controlled by:
- **Facebook** (owns your social data)
- **Google** (tracks your location)
- **Banks** (control your financial identity)
- **Companies** (store and sell your data)

### The Question:
> *"What if YOU owned your identity instead?"*

---

## 🔐 The Solution: Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

### Simple Analogy:

**Today:**
You give everyone a photocopy of your ID → They keep it forever → Data breaches expose it

**Tomorrow (SSI):**
You show your ID → They verify what they need → You put it back in your pocket

### Real Example:
```
Website: "Are you over 18?"
Your SSI Wallet: "Yes." ✓
(No account created, no birthday stored, no data breach risk)
```

---

## 🎮 Our Game: Experience SSI Through Play

### You're a Kiosk Clerk
**Your job:** Check IDs, sell items, make choices.

**The twist:** Every customer tests your principles.

---

## 📖 Three Scenarios That Teach SSI

### 1. Fridgy 🤖 (The Robot Buying Beer)
**Setup:** A sentient fridge wants beer for its owner.

**Your Choice:**
- ✅ Request both IDs (robot + owner) → Follow protocol
- ⚠️ Skip it, save time → +15 corruption points

**Teaches:** SSI allows layered verification. Shortcuts have consequences.

---

### 2. Amon 👦 (The Underage Kid)
**Setup:** Teen with dad's ID wants beer.

**SSI Shows:**
- ✓ Picture: Middle-aged man
- ✓ Age: Over 18
- ❌ Face doesn't match person in front of you

**Your Choice:**
- Reject the sale → Stay clean
- Accept bribe → +30 corruption → **Police arrest you**

**Teaches:** SSI makes fraud harder. Human judgment still matters.

---

### 3. Shaun Bakers 💰 (The Data Broker)
**Setup:** Shady guy offers 1000 NEU for customer data.

**Context:**
"Before SSI, companies sold your data freely. Now it's locked. But YOU have access..."

**Your Choice:**
- Refuse → Stay ethical
- Sell data → +15 corruption, money, guilt

**Teaches:** Why SSI exists - to stop data exploitation. You're the weak link.

---

## ⚖️ The Morality System

### Corruption Meter:
```
🟢 0 points:    Clean record → Normal ending
🟡 15 points:   Police warning → They're watching you
🔴 30 points:   Arrested → Game over
```

### The Key:
Not everyone sees the police. If you're ethical, they never appear. **Consequences, not punishment.**

---

## 🔗 How This Teaches SSI

Players learn through experience:

1. **Data Minimization** - Only ask for what you need
2. **User Control** - Customer decides what to share
3. **Consequences** - Violations have real penalties

---

## 💡 Why This Matters

### SSI Is Already Here:
- 🇪🇺 **EU Digital Identity Wallet** - Launching 2024
- 🇪🇪 **Estonia** - Digital residency with SSI
- 🇨🇦 **Canada** - Verifiable credentials for immigration

### The Gap:
Most people don't understand SSI or why it matters.

### Our Approach:
**Don't explain it. Let them experience it.**

---

## 📊 What We've Built

### Fully Playable:
- ✅ Tutorial scene (3 NPCs teaching SSI)
- ✅ Multiple scenarios (Fridgy, Amon, Shaun, Police)
- ✅ Corruption tracking (0-30 points)
- ✅ Dynamic police scenarios (inject at thresholds)
- ✅ Multiple endings (clean, warning, arrest)

---

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Students (16-25)** - Learning about privacy, blockchain, digital ethics
- **Educators** - Teaching SSI concepts interactively
- **Gamers** - Who enjoy narrative-driven, choice-based games

**Play time:** 20-30 minutes | **Replayable:** Multiple paths

---

## 🎬 The Vision

> *"Privacy isn't about having something to hide. It's about having something to protect."*

**Project Kiosk** teaches the future of digital identity - not through lectures, but through **choices**.

When players finish, they:
1. ✅ Understand what SSI is
2. ✅ Know why it matters
3. ✅ Recognize the ethics of data handling
