                    SCENARIO SYSTEM - QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

WHAT THIS IS:
-------------
This file controls which customer scenarios play and in what order.
The system is already set up and working. You just need to understand how
to add or modify scenarios.


WHERE IT LIVES:
---------------
File: Assets/Resources/ScenarioConfig.json
Script: Assets/SaabScripts/ScenarioManager.cs


CURRENT SCENARIOS:
------------------
The game currently has these customer scenarios:
1. Fridgy (AI fridge)
2. ConspiracyGuy (Conspiracy theorist)
3. Amon (Regular customer)
4. Robin (Tourist)

These shuffle randomly each playthrough (so Robin might appear before Fridgy).

NOTE: Police scenarios are NOT in this list. They're triggered automatically
when your corruption score reaches 50 or 70 points. See ScoreManager for that.


HOW TO ADD A NEW SCENARIO:
--------------------------
1. Create your scenario JSON file in Assets/Resources/
   Example: "NewCustomer_Scenario.json"

2. Create the NPC prefab in Assets/Resources/NPC_Prefabs/

3. Create the ID prefab in Assets/Resources/ID_Prefabs/

4. Open ScenarioConfig.json and add your scenario:

   {
     "filename": "NewCustomer_Scenario",
     "displayName": "New Customer",
     "followUpScenario": ""
   }

5. Save and test. Your scenario will now appear in the rotation.


SCENARIO ORDER OPTIONS:
-----------------------
Shuffle ON (current setting):
  - "shuffleEnabled": true
  - Scenarios play in random order each time
  - Good for replayability

Shuffle OFF:
  - "shuffleEnabled": false
  - Scenarios play in the order listed
  - Good for testing specific sequences


FOLLOW-UP SCENARIOS:
--------------------
A follow-up scenario plays IMMEDIATELY after another scenario, ignoring shuffle.

Example:
{
  "filename": "ShadyGuy_Scenario",
  "displayName": "Shady Guy",
  "followUpScenario": "PoliceGuy_Intro_Scenario"
}

Result: Whenever Shady Guy finishes, Police Intro plays next (even if shuffle
is on). Police Intro is NOT added to the shuffle pool.

Current setup: No follow-ups are used. Police scenarios trigger via corruption
score instead.


EXAMPLE CONFIG FILE:
--------------------
{
  "shuffleEnabled": true,
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "filename": "Fridgy_Scenario",
      "displayName": "Fridgy",
      "followUpScenario": ""
    },
    {
      "filename": "Robin_Scenario",
      "displayName": "Robin",
      "followUpScenario": ""
    }
  ]
}


HOW IT WORKS BEHIND THE SCENES:
--------------------------------
1. GameplayScene loads
2. ScenarioManager reads ScenarioConfig.json
3. Builds a list of scenarios
4. If shuffleEnabled is true, randomizes the list
5. Converts to a queue (first-in-first-out)
6. DialogueManager asks "what's next?"
7. ScenarioManager returns the next filename
8. DialogueManager loads that JSON and runs it
9. When done, asks for the next one
10. Repeat until queue is empty
11. Show end credits


TESTING YOUR CHANGES:
---------------------
1. Edit ScenarioConfig.json
2. Save the file
3. Press Play in Unity
4. Your changes take effect immediately (no rebuild needed)

Check Console for logs:
- "Loaded ScenarioConfig with X scenarios. Shuffle: True"
- "Shuffled scenario order: [list]"
- "Next scenario: [name]"


COMMON ISSUES:
--------------
Problem: "JSON file not found in Resources"
Solution: Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive, no .json extension)

Problem: Scenarios don't shuffle
Solution: Check "shuffleEnabled": true in ScenarioConfig.json

Problem: Scenario appears twice
Solution: Check you didn't add it to the list twice

Problem: Police scenarios don't trigger
Solution: Police scenarios are triggered by ScoreManager, not ScenarioConfig.
         Check your corruption score thresholds in ScoreManager Inspector.


WHERE TO GET HELP:
------------------
- Read PROJEKTKIOSK_COMPLETE_GUIDE.md (main documentation)
- Check Unity Console for error messages
- Look at existing scenario JSON files for examples
- Ask your supervisor with specific error messages
